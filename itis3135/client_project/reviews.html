        <h1>Customer Reviews & Partner Feedback</h1>
        <p>
          We treat every delivery, move, and install as an opportunity to earn
          another 5-star review. Here is a sample of the feedback Deliverr
          Trucking LLC has received from builders and homeowners.

              “You currently have all <strong>5-star reviews</strong> on this site.
              The crew did a great job on the venting of the microwave and
              documented that cabinets were not yet ready for install.
              Communication with the builder was clear, and the notes
              protected everyone on site.”

            This type of feedback reflects how we work: communicate clearly,
            do the job right, and document anything that might impact the
            installation or schedule.
