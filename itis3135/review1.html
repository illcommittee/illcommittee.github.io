        <h3>A Checklist for Each Page (from the top)</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Your submission leads right to the page to be reviewed
            <ul>
              <li>The home page loads directly and the navigation links to all client pages (Home, About, Events, Resources, Join).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names
            <ul>
              <li>Folder and file names appear lowercase with no spaces (for example, <code>mtc_client/index.html</code>).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Design
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Page has sufficient contrast / font sizing
                <ul>
                  <li>Text is generally readable. It would still be worth double-checking contrast on all text for accessibility.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Page has site colors and fonts using the standard CSS file
                <ul>
                  <li>Colors and typography are consistent across the site and appear to come from a shared stylesheet.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                CRAP
                <ol type="i">
                  <li>Contrast – overall good, with a few areas that could be refined.</li>
                  <li>Repetition – navigation and heading styles are consistent on every page.</li>
                  <li>Alignment – sections line up cleanly and content is easy to scan.</li>
                  <li>Proximity – related items (events, resources, join information) are grouped logically.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>
            Page has within it:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Header</li>
              <li>Main</li>
              <li>Footer</li>
              <li>(optional) nav for main menu between header and main</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
              <li>Each page has a clear top area, navigation, main content, and footer.</li>
              <li>It would strengthen the structure to explicitly use semantic <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tags if those are not already in place.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Header has site/brand header with text in an <code>h1</code>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>If this is a branded page it should be the brand/company.</li>
              <li>DO NOT include the page name in the header.</li>
              <li>Understand the difference between head, header, and heading.</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
              <li>“Muslim Technology Collaborative” is clearly shown as the brand on each page.</li>
              <li>It would be good to ensure this brand name is marked up as the single <code>h1</code>, and page titles like “About Us” or “Events” are <code>h2</code> elements inside <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, not repeated in the header.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Main starts with name of page as an <code>h2</code> and does not include name of site/brand
            <ul>
              <li>Each page has a clear title (About Us, Events, Resources, Join).</li>
              <li>Just confirm those titles are coded as <code>h2</code> in <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> for full compliance with the course pattern.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Page has brand tagline somewhere (consistent on every page)
            <ul>
              <li>The brand name is consistent, but there is not yet a short tagline.</li>
              <li>Suggestion: add something like “Connecting Muslim students in tech at UNC Charlotte” under the logo on all pages for a stronger brand identity.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Page has footer with
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Menu for user’s pages</li>
              <li>HTML validation button/link and validates</li>
              <li>CSS validation button/link and validates</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
              <li>The footer currently includes copyright information.</li>
              <li>Adding a small navigation menu in the footer would make it easier to move between pages from the bottom of the site.</li>
              <li>At this point, I did not see HTML/CSS validation buttons. These still need to be added and connected to the correct URLs once the pages validate.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Page has specific requirements for this assignment
            <ul>
              <li>The client site feels appropriate for a real organization with Home, About, Events, Resources, and Join pages.</li>
              <li>The Resources page is especially strong and gives visitors real value.</li>
              <li>“Show Leadership” and “Hello World” read as placeholders; these should be replaced with actual content or removed before the final version.</li>
              <li>The Join section would be stronger as a proper form with labels, inputs, and clear confirmation behavior for the user.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Additional Notes (Stop / Start / Continue)</h3>
        <p><strong>Stop:</strong> leaving placeholder text as the site gets closer to final.</p>
        <p><strong>Start:</strong> adding a consistent tagline, improving the Join form, and tightening accessibility (contrast, alt text, and descriptive link text).</p>
        <p><strong>Continue:</strong> using clear headings, strong resources, and good section organization. The overall structure of the site is already very solid.</p>
