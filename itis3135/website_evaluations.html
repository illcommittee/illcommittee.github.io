        <h5>Evaluating the effectiveness of website design through CRAP principles</h5>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://gkc.ca/en" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Good Example: GKC</a></h3>
            <p>GKC is an incredibly well designed website, that follows modern CRAP principles with modern design, and an astonishing and smooth flow to their content.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Excellent use of color contrast, text is easily readable and smooth on the eyes.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Also has a very consistent layout throughout the entire website, fonts, colors, even spacing are all well-defined.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> A very unique grid layout that draws the eye to align text and items evenly.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Items are grouped in a logical pattern that follows the path of the eyes, and improves readability.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Bad Example: Yale School of Art</a></h3>
            <p>While the Yale School of Art website has a visually creative design, it is incredibly disorganized and seemingly outdated. Navigation and readability are very compromised when viewing the site.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> A very busy background where the text, while easy to read, clashes harshly with the background.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Seemingly no repetition throughout the site, and elements are inconsistent from page to page.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Random elements don't really seem to align with anything, in fact, the whole web page feels skewed in one direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Overall, related elements seem separated and visually just random. At least the elements are close to each other?</li>
            </ul>
